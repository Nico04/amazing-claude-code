   * the menu, one for itself - and lit nothing under the pointer on the way. Lifting it above the scrim,
   * as the selectors are, cannot work: it stands in the feed's .content, whose translateZ(0) is a stacking
   * context of its own, and no z-index inside one reaches past it.
   *
   * The same goes for whatever in the feed opens a file or a picture - a chip, a path, the line of what the
   * editor showed: the menu is open over a message, and what that message points at is the next thing
   * reached for.
   *
   * So over such a control (see pastMenu) the scrim steps aside, and the control gets the pointer itself:
   * its hover, its hint and the hand cursor (the last two are read from the element under the mouse, see
   * Tooltips and the cursor in App), the picture behind a chip, and then its click - on which the menu
   * closes, as on any click beside it. Asked on every movement, for the same reason as the highlight of
   * the entries: one lost event must not leave the scrim open or shut. Written on the node rather than
   * through state: a movement is no reason to render.
