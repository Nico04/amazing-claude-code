/**
 * What the statistics tab is handed: the machine's days in full, the tokens by the hour, every project's
 * tokens by day, and the achievements as they stand.
 *
 * The days travel folded together rather than one project at a time (see StatsSnapshot.daysTogether).
 * The tab is about a person's work, and the same person's hour does not become two hours because two
 * windows were open - which is what "this project's days, and everybody else's minutes underneath" made
 * of it: the big figure was one project's while the line under it added the others up, and the two
 * disagreed about the same afternoon. The one place the work is still broken up by project is the list of
 * where the tokens went, and its tokens are what the projects carry here.
 *
 * The interface does the arithmetic of a range - the last week, the last month, all time - out of the
 * days themselves, so switching the range never comes back here. Nothing here names a path: a project is
 * its name and an opaque key (see StatsCollector.keyOf).
