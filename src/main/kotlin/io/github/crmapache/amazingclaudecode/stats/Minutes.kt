/**
 * The minutes of one day something happened in - a bit per minute, 1440 of them.
 *
 * Time in the panel is counted this way rather than as a running total of seconds: a minute is either
 * active or it is not, and marking the same minute twice costs nothing. That is what makes the sources
 * easy to add up - a turn running, a message sent, a hand on the keyboard - without one of them counting
 * a moment the other has already counted.
 *
 * The statistics tab no longer shows the time itself - a panel left open says little about the work, and
 * the tokens say it better. The minutes still decide which days were worked (see DayRecord.isActive), and
 * the anonymous usage report reads its sittings off them (see UsageReport).
