/**
 * The tokens Claude spent, by the hour, read out of the CLI's transcripts into the book - what the
 * statistics tab draws a day at a time, and what the "tok" figure by the composer says about today.
 *
 * The transcripts rather than the turns the panel watches, because the turns undercount by a long way. A
 * turn's result reports its main thread only - the subagents it ran are not in it - and a scenario run's
 * head and cards never pass through a tab at all. Measured on 2026-10-16: the turns came to 0.64B tokens,
 * the transcripts of the same day to 2.79B, two billion of them in one project's scenario runs.
 *
 * Kept in the book rather than read afresh each time. A first reading goes through gigabytes, and the CLI
 * deletes transcripts after a month (cleanupPeriodDays): the book keeps what they said after they are gone.
 * After the first, a reading opens only the files changed since the one before (see [SLACK_MS]), which is
 * what the counter by the composer always read anyway.
 *
 * Every answer is also put down to the project it was spent in (see [projectOf]) - the tab's list of where
 * the tokens went. A book that has never had them by project is read from the first transcript again (see
 * TokenHome.projectsReadAt): the history by project is filled in from everything still on the disk.
