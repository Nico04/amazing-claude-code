/**
 * Everything a turn changed in the project, found on the disk - rather than in the calls that report on it.
 *
 * The list under a turn was drawn from the edit tools' results, and a turn changes files by much more than those. Reported
 * by Max 2026-10-24 with a screenshot: the IDE's commit window said 156 files, the list under the turn said five. All of
 * it was that one turn, an hour long: the agent changed most files with Python and `sed` through Bash (the CLI's own
 * system prompt in bypass mode tells it to), and four background subagents edited sixteen more - their results reach the
 * stream without the structured half the list is counted from (measured on 2.1.293). Neither says a word about a diff.
 *
 * So the project is written down as the turn begins and again as it ends ([WorkTreeSnapshots]), and every file that
 * differs between the two is the turn's - with the diff from one to the other, which is what the row counts and what a
 * revert undoes. Its edits, its scripts, its subagents, a formatter after them, a generator it ran: all one picture.
 *
 * What changed on the disk while the turn ran is not always the turn's, and two kinds are left out:
 * - a file the IDE itself wrote (an editor saved, a refactoring, a revert of an earlier turn) - the person's work, which
 *   a "Revert all" must never take away. The IDE tells its own writes from outside ones (see [noteIdeWrite]);
 * - a file another tab's agent named in its edit calls while this turn ran - its edit, not this one's.
 *   A file the turn's own calls named stays whatever else touched it.
 * What neither can tell apart stays in: another tab's Bash in the same project at the same moment, a terminal beside
 * the IDE. Both are rare, and a revert of such a file refuses or is brought back by the same row.
 *
 * A turn is measured from the moment a person's message went in - or, for a turn the CLI started by itself (a
 * background agent reporting back), from the end of the turn before: the work in between is the agents', and it is
 * this turn that reports it.
