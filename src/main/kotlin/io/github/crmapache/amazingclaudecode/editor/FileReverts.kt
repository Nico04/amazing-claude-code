/**
 * The disk half of [ChangeRevert]: one file read, its turn undone - or made again - and the result written
 * back.
 *
 * Through the file's document and as a command of the IDE, rather than straight onto the disk. That way an
 * editor showing the file changes in place, and the revert is one more step on that editor's undo - a person
 * who pressed the wrong row takes it back with the key they already know. A file the turn created is deleted
 * the same way, so the IDE's local history keeps it, and is written anew when the changes are brought back.
 *
 * Runs off the event thread: the file is refreshed from the disk first (the agent wrote it from outside, and
 * the IDE's picture may be a step behind), and that is a walk of the disk. The edit itself goes to the event
 * thread, as every write to a document must.
