/**
 * The IDE's side of the feedback screen: the debug report it offers to copy.
 *
 * The screen used to be a form whose message, files and report this desk posted to a service that put them
 * in the author's Telegram. That is gone - the screen now names the two ways a change gets in (a tip with
 * the wish written in it, a pull request) and takes no message at all - and with it went the one request
 * the plugin made of the internet on a person's behalf. What stayed is the report: built here from what the
 * plugin itself saw, shown whole, and copied by the person into a pull request or a reply.
 *
 * It lives with the panel's window rather than with the conversation hub, and that placement is still the
 * point. Everything about a conversation goes through SessionCommands, which is also the door a paired
 * phone comes in by; this goes through the window's own handler instead, where a remote client does not
 * arrive at all (see ClaudePanel). The report is built out of a conversation's journal, and a message that
 * reads that should be unreachable from outside by construction, not only by being on a list - though it
 * is on that list too (see RemoteCommands).
